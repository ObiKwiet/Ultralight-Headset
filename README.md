# Ultralight Headset
This is a project to make a better communications headset for ultralights, but specifically for paramotors. 

## Goals
- Modularity - Everyone's needs and budget are a little different, so we want to make it possible put together certain features a la carte.
- ANR - Active noise cancelation modules are rare for UL headsets, but they are the only way of effectively attenuating the low frequencies generated by our two stroke engines and prop. 
- Wireless links - The helmet itself should have a wireless link to other system components. Reducing the number of wires around us is not only convenient, but also an important safety improvement. This should also reduce cost and labor by eliminating a complex cable assembly, and expensive connectors.
- Radio connectivity - The system should accommodate at least two simultaneous analog radios, cell phone connectivity, and bluetooth intercom.  
-Side tone - The system should feed the microphone signal back into the speakers for the comfort of the user. 

## Roadmap
